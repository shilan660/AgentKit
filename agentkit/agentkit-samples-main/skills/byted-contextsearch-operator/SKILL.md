# Volcano Engine ContextSearch

Manage ContextSearch on Volcano Engine — application control-plane operations plus runtime data-plane search/chat against configured context endpoints.

## Quick Start

Use the bundled CLIs (always run via the skill venv):

```bash
{baseDir}/venv/bin/python {baseDir}/scripts/control.py <command>
{baseDir}/venv/bin/python {baseDir}/scripts/data.py <command>
{baseDir}/venv/bin/python {baseDir}/scripts/context_search.py <command>
```

If `{baseDir}/venv` does not exist:

```bash
python3 -m venv {baseDir}/venv
{baseDir}/venv/bin/pip install -r {baseDir}/requirements.txt
```

See [references/control_plane.md](references/control_plane.md) and [references/data_plane.md](references/data_plane.md) for workflows and examples.

Low-level fallback (use only when goal-based commands do not cover the task):

```bash
{baseDir}/venv/bin/python {baseDir}/scripts/contextsearch_cli.py <namespace> <command>
```

See [references/control_tools.md](references/control_tools.md) and [references/control_coverage.md](references/control_coverage.md).

## Available operations

**Control Plane** (application console operations): Use goal-based workflows and console action commands to create AgenticSearch, manage scenes, data sources, indexers, search configs, Agentic tools/skills/variables/chats/users, models, deployments, PSR resources, network, specs, and API keys.
→ See [references/control_plane.md](references/control_plane.md).

**Data Plane** (runtime search/chat): Use the bundled data-plane scripts to list configured contexts, search context-aware indexes, and chat with RAG-backed knowledge bases.
→ See [references/data_plane.md](references/data_plane.md).

**Low-level tools**: Use `scripts/contextsearch_cli.py console` or `openapi` only when `control.py` does not cover a specific console action.
→ See [references/control_tools.md](references/control_tools.md).

## Out of scope

- Operating non-Volcano-Engine ContextSearch deployments.
- Designing full application-level RAG/AgenticSearch architecture beyond the fields needed to run the provided commands.
- Guessing unknown request bodies, context endpoints, API keys, IDs, or credentials. If a body shape is not clear, inspect the relevant console request shape or ask the user for required fields.

## Rules

**Common**
- **Execution environment**: Always use `{baseDir}/venv/bin/python` to run scripts.
- **Control-plane authentication**: Console operations require `VOLCENGINE_AK` and `VOLCENGINE_SK`. Use `VOLCENGINE_REGION` only when the default `cn-beijing` is not correct.
- **Data-plane authentication**: Runtime search/chat requires `CTX_SEARCH_API_KEY` plus `{baseDir}/config.json` created from `{baseDir}/config.json.template`.
- **Script usage**: Use `scripts/control.py` for console operations. Use `scripts/data.py` or `scripts/context_search.py` for runtime search/chat. Use `scripts/contextsearch_cli.py` only as a last resort when `control.py` does not cover the console action.
- **Console parity**: For AgenticSearch creation, use `control.py create-agentic-search`; it follows the console chain `ListAgenticSceneTemplate -> CheckBuiltinDeployment -> DeployBuiltinDeployment -> CreateAgenticScene`.
- **Output handling**: Commands return JSON. Make decisions from `status`, `goal`, `data`, and `steps_completed`.
- **Language (strict)**: Always reply in the user's language. If the user's message contains Chinese characters, reply in Chinese. Keep commands/flags/code in English.

**Control plane**
- **Console boundary**: Treat ContextSearch console operations as control-plane operations, including Agentic data source/indexer/search-config setup.
- **Destructive actions (strict)**: Never run delete operations until:
  1. You first fetch and show what will be deleted.
  2. The user replies with an explicit confirmation phrase that includes the exact target identifier.
  3. You pass that exact target identifier into the CLI `--confirm` argument when the goal-based command supports it.
- **Missing parameters**: Never fail silently. Inspect available resources or ask one concise question.
- **Mutation retry safety**: If a mutation may have been submitted but the result is unclear, observe with a get/list command before retrying.

**Data plane**
- **Context config**: Never invent `base_url`, context names, or `CTX_SEARCH_API_KEY`.
- **Context types**: `knowledge_base` supports `search` and `chat`; `image` and `video` support `search` only.
- **Modes and size**: For data-plane search/chat, omit `--mode` and `--size` unless the user explicitly asks for them. For image/video search, only `quick` is valid when a mode is specified.
- **Image/video search**: The data-plane script automatically requests download info and chooses public download URLs only for `.volces.com` hosts.
